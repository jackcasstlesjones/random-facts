# Random Fact Generator

## Description

This project allows a user to log on and see a random fact. If the user wants more, they are able to generate another!

### I wanted this project to:

- Utilise an external API
- Allow the user to cycle through random facts
- Be aesthetically pleasing

## Features

- Uses a colour scheme generated from [coolors](https://coolors.co/)
- Makes a call to the API Ninjas [Fact API](https://api-ninjas.com/api/facts)
- Adjusts text size depending on the length of the fact returned
